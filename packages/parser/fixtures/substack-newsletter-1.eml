ith him.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=94 Charlo
Yesterday my pet rabbit bit my finger. It was an accident; he was trying to=
 bite a towel to move it out of his way, and I accidentally stuck my hand i=
n his mouth. He is a gentle beast, and would never bite a human intentional=
ly. Anyway, the bite punctured and lacerated my left index finger near the =
front knuckle. I washed it out, put some ointment and a band-aid on it, and=
 that was that.
It occurs to me that if my pet rabbit had instead been a tiger, I would now=
 be dead. There is a reason most people don=E2=80=99t keep tigers as pets; =

e, AI doesn=E2=80=99t think exactly the way you do. It probably never will,=
 in the same sense that a submarine will never paddle its fins and an airpl=

 and an airplane can fly higher and faster than any bird, so it doesn=E2=80=

Right now, there are some cognitive things that humans still do better than=
 AI, but that will probably not last. The entire might of the world=E2=80=
=99s technological innovation system is now being thrown into making AI bet=
ter, and there is no sign of a slowdown in progress. One of the main things=
 AI couldn=E2=80=99t do until recently was to work on a task for a long per=
iod of time. That=E2=80=99s changing fast. AI models are flying up the METR=
 curve, which tries to measure the length of time they can take to complete=
 a software engineering task:
This is what=E2=80=99s behind all the =E2=80=9Cvibe coding=E2=80=9D you=E2=
=80=99re hearing about. AI agents =E2=80=94 basically, a program that keeps=
 applying AI over and over until a task is complete =E2=80=94 are now takin=
g over much of software engineering. People just tell the AI what kind of s=
oftware they want, and the AI pops it out. Human software engineers are sti=
ll checking the code for problems, but as the technology improves, the cost=
 of doing this is likely to become uneconomical; AI-written software will n=
ever be perfect, but it=E2=80=99ll be consistently much better than anythin=
g humans could do, and at a tiny fraction of the price.=20

kbncifQ.qTvoIDjk3U3G9Td34CeFwYb7BfAOkO-PNiz7RTdD8x0 ] for very much longer.
And all of this =E2=80=94 ending software engineering as we know it, acing =
the hardest math tests, solving unsolved math problems, creating infinite a=
pps at the touch of a button =E2=80=94 is just the beginning. The amount of=
 resources that the world is preparing to deploy to improve AI, this year a=
nd in the following few years, utterly dwarfs anything that it has deployed=
 so far:
AI=E2=80=99s abilities scale with the amount of compute applied. The amount=
 of compute available this year will be much greater than the amount that=
=E2=80=99s producing all the miracles you see now. And then next year=E2=80=
=99s compute will be far greater than that. All the while, AI itself will b=
e searching for ways to improve AI algorithms to better take advantage of i=
ncreased compute.=20
Other weaknesses of AI =E2=80=94 in particular, its lack of long-term memor=
y and its inability to learn on the fly =E2=80=94 will eventually be solved=
=2E AI will be able to act on its own f=
or longer and longer, with less and le=
ss human decision-making in the loop. Meanwhile, massive investment in robo=
tics will give AI more and more direct contact with, understanding of, and =
control of the physical world.=20
More and more people are waking up to this reality. An article by Matt Shum=
er called =E2=80=9CSomething Big is Happening [ https://substack.com/redire=

9Td34CeFwYb7BfAOkO-PNiz7RTdD8x0 ]=E2=80=9D recently went viral. It=E2=80=99=
s very simplified and hand-wavey, and Shumer himself is a bit of a huckster=
 [ https://substack.com/redirect/bd0fa00b-d155-48f1-b037-326ca4d5f307?j=3De=
yJ1IjoiYnBkbncifQ.qTvoIDjk3U3G9Td34CeFwYb7BfAOkO-PNiz7RTdD8x0 ], but it get=
s the point across. If anything it understates the pace and magnitude of th=
e changes taking place. I recommend giving it a read, if you haven=E2=80=99=
t already.
But there=E2=80=99s a bigger reality out there that people outside the tech=
 industry =E2=80=94 and even many people within it =E2=80=94 don=E2=80=99t =
seem to have grasped yet. It isn=E2=80=99t just that AI could take your job=
, or put millions of people on welfare, or give us infinite free software, =
or whatever. It=E2=80=99s that for the first time in all of recorded histor=
y, humans no longer are =E2=80=94 or soon no longer will be =E2=80=94 the m=
ost intelligent beings on this planet, in any meaningful functional sense o=
f the word.=20
For the rest of our lives, we=E2=80=99ll all be sleeping next to a tiger...
